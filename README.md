# Taco Bell -- Snippets

## Build Setup


## Notes/Recommendations
The new redesign templates are located in the TB_Shell_v0_1.html file. The og file refers to the old design. Each component is broken out into snippets within the new_layout folder as well.

Note that some of the designs provided on the Sketch file are inconsistent with wireframes provided. Ideally, the design should abide by the stated specs but in the case that is not, spacing/sizes will have to be updated to closer match the design. 

Some examples do not have a mobile design provided so image scaling will a bit off on certain mobile screen sizes - this is specifically regarding the hero components. In the scenario that mobile assets are not provided, ideally the background image bleeds into a solid color so an added bgcolor can make up the differences in height/size of the container. 

## Email Quirks
AppleMail (Native iOS app) - occassionally you will have to refresh or switch between viewing emails in order to get full/updated rendering. This is an AppleMail iOS exclusive bug.
