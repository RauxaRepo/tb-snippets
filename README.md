# Taco Bell -- Snippets

## Build Setup


## Notes/Recommendations
Some of the designs are inconsistent with wireframes provided. Ideally, the design should abide by the stated specs but in the case that is not spacing/sizes will have to be updated to closer match the design. 

Some examples do not have a mobile design provided so scaling is off on certain mobile screen sizes - specifically the heroes. In the case that mobile assets are not provided, ideally the background image bleeds into a solid color so a coded bgcolor can make up the differences in height/size of the container. 

## Email Quirks
AppleMail (Native iOS app) - occassionally you will have to refresh or switch between viewing emails in order to get full/updated rendering. This is an AppleMail iOS exclusive bug.
